# Photo_to_Cartoon_with_Pencilsketch
### My simple photo to cartoon with pencil sketch using image processing

This Python code uses the OpenCV library to convert an input image into a cartoon-like image with a pencil-sketch effect. The code applies various image processing techniques such as median blur, adaptive thresholding, bilateral filtering, bitwise operations, and pencil-sketch effect to achieve the cartoon-like effect.

## Requirements

1.  Python 3
2.  OpenCV library (cv2)
3.  NumPy library (numpy)

## Getting Started

To use this code, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system.

## How to use

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2.  Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3.  Replace the input image with your own image by changing the filename in the cv2.imread() function.
4.  Run the script using the command "python Photo_to_cartoon.py".
5.  The output will be displayed on the screen with the original and cartoon images side by side.
